### Actions
- Enhanced `useActivityData` hook to support 60s polling and optional "Live" mode using GitHub Events API.
- Implemented ETag support for GitHub API requests to optimize rate limit usage.
- Added GitHub event transformation logic to merge live activity into the existing dashboard data structure.
- Updated `App.tsx` to handle new hook states (mode, lastFetched, isRateLimited).
- Updated `ActivityFeed.tsx` with a Live/Static toggle, real-time "Last updated" indicator, and rate limit warnings.
- Verified the implementation with `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build`.

### Files Changed
- `web/src/hooks/useActivityData.ts`: Added polling, Live mode logic, ETag support, and event transformation.
- `web/src/App.tsx`: Integrated new hook features and passed props to `ActivityFeed`.
- `web/src/components/ActivityFeed.tsx`: Added UI for mode switching and status reporting.

### Next Steps
- Implement persistent caching for ETags and data in `localStorage` to survive page reloads.
- Add more granular event types (e.g., comments, reviews) to the Live feed.
- Consider implementing a "Force Refresh" button (already added basic icon but could be improved).
